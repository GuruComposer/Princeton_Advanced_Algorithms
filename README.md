# Algorithms, Part II

Cousera online course, Algorithms 2, created by Princeton
University, taught by: _Kevin Wayne_, Senior Lecturer and _Robert Sedgewick_,
Professor.

I am currently working through Princeton's Algorithms, Part II.
The emphasis in this course is placed on understanding advanced algorithms, and then
implementing it to solve a useful scientific problem. Part II covers algorithms on Undirected Graphs,
Directed Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest Paths, Max-flows, Tries, Substring Search,
Regular Expressions, Data Compression, Reductions and Intractability.

This codebase only covers the the parts of Part II that I've currently completed. All assignments uploaded
passed the correctness and time-space-complexity tests.

Thank you for reviewing my algorithms.
